<!-- 
  This is a simple page to allow for redirecting users to Firebase's password reset system
  from a 'Reset Password' link.
     
  The reason we need this is because when a password reset email is sent, if the email sender 
  and reset link do not map to the same domain, then the email gets quarantined by Microsoft 365,
  which means it doesn't even show up in the user's spam or junk folder. For some reason, the 
  default 'hackpsu18.firebaseapp.com' domain email also gets blocked, even if the domains match,
  so we cannot send from that email domain and must instead send from the 'hackpsu.org' email domain.
  Password authentication is handled through Firebase, though, so we must redirect to there to
  allow the user to change their password.

  Technically, the same result could probably also be achieved by defining a redirect in Namecheap,
  but those do not serve HTTPS, and instead only serve HTTP (unless you pay for an SSL certificate).
  For a user password reset, this would be insufficient security.
