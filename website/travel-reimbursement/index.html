<div id='ppHeader'>HackPSU Travel Reimbursement Policy</div>
<div id='ppBody'>
    <div class='innerText'>
        HackPSU offers single travelers up to $70 in
        reimbursements, groups of 2 or 3 hackers with up to $90, 
        and groups of 4+ hackers up to $110.
        <br>
        Participants arriving by bus or plane can be reimbursed up to
        $110. A taxi or ride sharing service (e.g Lyft or Uber) can also
        be reimbursed, but will count toward the participant's $110.
        <br>
        Original receipts must be provided at the event in order to
        receive any reimbursement. Digital receipts are accepted for
        bus/plane tickets and for gas on the participant's return trip
        only.
        <br>
        Reimbursements may take up to 2 months. HackPSU does not reimburse
        travel from the State College area or lodging/other
        accommodations.
